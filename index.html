         <h2>What Is Coffee</h2>
         <p>
            Coffee is a plant that grows all over the world. Coffee cherries grow along the branches of a coffee tree. The beans roasted and brewed are actually a seed from the coffee cherry. There are two main species of coffee: Typica and Bourbon.

         <h3>How To Brew</h3>
         <p>
            There are a variety of methods to brew coffee. These include french press, pour over, espresso, aeropress, auto drip, percolator, and cold brew. The best coffee starts with high quality coffee beans which can be determined by the country/region, variety, roast type, freshness, and brewing method. There are many important variables to set up success for the most delicious cup. That includes the temperature of the water, grind of the coffee, quality of the water, coffee-to-water ratio, and brewing time.

         <p>
            My personal favorite espresso drink is a cortado. The cortado is a beverage of two shots of espresso and two ounces of steamed milk. The equal parts ratio creates a perfect balance of milk and coffee. I even enjoy it over ice!

         <h5>Origin</h5>
         <p>
            Coffee is produced in countries like Ethiopia, Guatemela, Colombia, Mexico, Indonesia, and many more. The ideal conditions for coffee trees to thrive are found around the world in along the Equatorial zone called “The Bean Belt,” located between latitudes 25 degrees North and 30 degrees South. Between the time coffee is planted and picked, it must undergo a lot of processes to become the perfect seed. Coffee is planted and harvested by hand. Then, it is processed in either a dry or wet method. This is described as "natural" or "washed" on a coffee bag. The coffee must then be milled to remove any excess skin. Then, it is exported for taste of quality and graded. Finally, the coffee is roasted and ready to be enjoyed! Each step along the way is tedious and complex. Coffe requires the labor of hundreds of people before it reaches the cup.

         <h6>My Journey</h6>
         <p>
            I first started in coffee in 2018 with little to no coffee experience. I started as a barista and eventually worked my way up to General Manager of a St. Louis specialty coffee shop. From there, I took a break from coffee and returned at a different location. My dedication led me to judging the National Barista Championship which takes place every year and leads to a World Barista Champion. The coffee community is a place where diverse backgrounds come together to share experiences and cultivate the best coffee. There is so much more than coffee in this industry and I have learned so much about msyself and the world around me.
